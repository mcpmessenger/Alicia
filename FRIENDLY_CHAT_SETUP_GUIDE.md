# üéâ AI Pro - Friendly Chat Assistant Setup Guide

## Overview

Your Alexa skill has been transformed from a **shopping-focused assistant** into a **friendly AI research assistant** that can discuss any topic using Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic! Shopping capabilities are still available but are now subtle and secondary.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy the New Lambda Function

Run the deployment script:

```powershell
.\deploy-friendly-chat.ps1
```

This will:
1. Package `lambda_ai_pro_friendly_chat.py` as your main handler
2. Include shopping_tools.py for optional shopping features
3. Upload to your existing Lambda function
4. Create a deployment package

### Step 2: Configure API Keys

You need API keys from at least ONE provider (ideally all three for best experience):

#### Get API Keys:

1. **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5): https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Anthropic** (Claude): https://console.anthropic.com/
3. **Google Gemini**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

#### Set Environment Variables in Lambda:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name ai-pro-skill \
  --environment Variables='{
    "OPENAI_API_KEY":"sk-your-openai-key-here",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY":"sk-ant-your-anthropic-key",
    "GOOGLE_API_KEY":"your-google-gemini-key",
    "DYNAMODB_TABLE":"ai-assistant-users-dev"
  }' \
  --region us-east-1
```

Or set them in the AWS Console:
1. Go to AWS Lambda ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí `ai-pro-skill`
2. Configuration ‚Üí Environment variables
3. Add the keys above

## üéØ How to Use

### General Chat & Research (Primary Feature)

Users can ask ANYTHING:

**Science & Technology:**
- "Alexa, open AI Pro"

### Choosing AI Providers

Users can explicitly choose which AI to use:

**Use Gemini:**
- "Use Gemini to explain black holes"
- "Ask Gemini about ancient Rome"
- "Gemini, what is quantum computing?"

**Use Claude (Anthropic):**
- "Use Claude to tell me about philosophy"
- "Ask Claude about machine learning"
- "Claude, explain photosynthesis"

**Use OpenAI (GPT):**
- "Use OpenAI to write a poem"
- "Ask GPT about history"
- "OpenAI, what is AI?"

**Set a Default:**
- "Set Gemini as my default"
- "Make Claude my default"

1. Go to [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask)
2. Open your "AI Pro" skill
3. Click **Test** tab
4. Enable testing: "Development"

### Test Queries:

```
Alexa, open AI Pro
> "Hey! I'm AI Pro. I love chatting about anything..."

Tell me about black holes
> [Detailed, conversational explanation]

Use Gemini to explain quantum physics
> [Gemini-powered explanation]

Find me wireless headphones
> [Shows product search results with shopping UI]
```

## üìä Comparison: Before vs After

| Feature | Before (Shopping Focus) | After (Chat Focus) |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|

## üîß Customization

### Change Welcome Messages

Edit `lambda_ai_pro_friendly_chat.py`:

```python
WELCOME_MESSAGES = [
    "Your custom welcome message here!",
    "Another friendly greeting!",
    # Add as many as you like
]
```

### Adjust AI Response Length

In each AI function (`call_openai`, `call_anthropic`, `call_gemini`):

```python
"max_tokens": 200,  # Change this (150-500 recommended for voice)
"temperature": 0.8   # Creativity (0.7-0.9 for friendly chat)
```

### Modify Shopping Detection

Edit the `SHOPPING_KEYWORDS` list to be more or less sensitive:

```python
SHOPPING_KEYWORDS = [
    'buy', 'purchase', 'shop', 'find product',
    # Add or remove keywords
]
```

---

## üé® Interaction Model

Your current interaction model in `alexa-interaction-model.json` should work as-is! The `LLMQueryIntent` handles both chat and shopping based on context.

If you want to emphasize chat over shopping, consider:

1. Adding more conversational sample utterances
2. Creating dedicated research/question intents
3. Moving shopping to a separate, explicit intent

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Best User Experience:

1. **Configure All 3 Providers**: Users love choice!
2. **Monitor Costs**: AI API calls have costs - set usage limits
3. **Test Voice Responses**: Some AI responses are long - optimize for voice
4. **Use Conversation History**: The skill remembers recent chats for context

### For Development:

1. **Check Logs**: CloudWatch logs show which AI provider is being used
2. **DynamoDB Tables**: Stores user preferences and conversation history
3. **Error Handling**: Falls back gracefully if an AI provider is unavailable

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "I didn't quite catch that"
- API key may be missing or invalid
- Check Lambda environment variables
- Verify DynamoDB table exists

### Shopping Not Working
- This is expected for non-shopping queries!
- Use explicit shopping words: "find", "buy", "shop for"

### Wrong AI Provider Responding
- Set your default: "Set Gemini as my default"
- Or specify in query: "Use Claude to..."

### Skill Not Updating
1. Redeploy: `.\deploy-friendly-chat.ps1`
2. Clear Alexa cache: Say "Alexa, exit" and reopen
3. Check Lambda logs in CloudWatch
