## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Add these to your Lambda function:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # Your OpenAI API key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...    # (Optional) For Claude
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AI...            # (Optional) For Gemini
DYNAMODB_TABLE=ai-assistant-users-dev
AMAZON_PARTNER_TAG=aipro00-20
```

### Step 2: Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
4. Add to Lambda environment variables

### Step 3: Deploy Lambda Function

```bash
# Package the function
cd "C:\Users\senti\OneDrive\Desktop\AI Pro Skill"
Compress-Archive -Path "lambda_ai_pro_general.py","shopping_tools.py" -DestinationPath "lambda-general-ai.zip" -Force

# Deploy to AWS
aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name ai-pro-alexa-skill \
  --zip-file fileb://lambda-general-ai.zip

# Update environment variables
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name ai-pro-alexa-skill \
  --environment "Variables={OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here,DYNAMODB_TABLE=ai-assistant-users-dev,AMAZON_PARTNER_TAG=aipro00-20}"
```

## ðŸ’¬ How It Works

### Conversation Flow

**Launch:**
```
User: "Alexa, open AI Pro"
AI Pro: "Hi! I'm AI Pro, your friendly assistant. I can chat about anything, 
        help you shop on Amazon, or manage your cart. What's on your mind?"
```

**General Chat:**
```
User: "What's the weather like today?"
AI Pro: "I don't have real-time weather data, but you can ask me anything else! 
        Want to know about a topic, need shopping help, or just want to chat?"

User: "Tell me a joke"
AI Pro: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! ðŸ˜„"
```

**Smart Shopping Detection:**
```
User: "I need new headphones"
AI Pro: [Detects "need" + "headphones" = shopping intent]
        "Great! I found 10 awesome options for headphones. Item 1: Sony WH-1000XM5..."
        [Shows beautiful APL display]
```

**Hybrid Conversation:**
```
User: "What's quantum computing?"
AI Pro: "Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics principles..."

User: "Cool! Can you find me a book about it?"
AI Pro: [Switches to shopping mode]
        "Sure! I found 'Quantum Computing for Everyone' at $29.99..."
```

## ðŸ§  Smart Intent Detection

### Shopping Keywords
The system automatically detects shopping intent when you say:
- buy, purchase, shop, shopping
- find product, looking for, search for
- need, want to buy, show me
- price, cost, deal, sale, discount

### Cart Keywords
Automatically routes to cart management when you say:
- cart, checkout, my order
- add item, remove item, clear cart
- view cart, show cart

### Everything Else
Routes to general AI chat for:
- Questions about any topic
- Casual conversation
- Weather, news, facts
- Jokes, stories, advice

## ðŸŽ¨ Friendly Features

### Randomized Welcome Messages
5 different welcome messages to keep it fresh:
1. "Hi! I'm AI Pro, your friendly assistant..."
2. "Hey there! I'm here to help with anything..."
3. "Welcome to AI Pro! Think of me as your helpful friend..."
4. "Hi! Ready to have a conversation..."
5. "Hey! I'm AI Pro - part conversational buddy..."

### Conversation Memory
- Remembers last 20 messages
- Maintains context across conversation
- Seamless topic switching

### Natural Language
- Conversational tone
- Voice-optimized responses (concise)
- Friendly and helpful personality

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test General Chat

**In Alexa Developer Console:**
```
1. "Alexa, open AI Pro"
   â†’ Should get friendly welcome

2. "What is artificial intelligence?"
   â†’ Should get conversational AI response

3. "Tell me a joke"
   â†’ Should get a joke

4. "What's 2+2?"
   â†’ Should answer with context
```

### Test Shopping Mode

**In Alexa Developer Console:**
```
1. "I need wireless headphones"
   â†’ Should detect shopping intent and show products

2. "Find me a laptop under $1000"
   â†’ Should search and display results with price filter

3. "Show me gaming chairs"
   â†’ Should display gaming chair products
```

### Test Hybrid Mode

**In Alexa Developer Console:**
```
1. "What's machine learning?"
   â†’ General AI response

2. "Can you find me a book about machine learning?"
   â†’ Should switch to shopping mode

3. "What's in my cart?"
   â†’ Should show cart contents

4. "Tell me more about neural networks"
   â†’ Should switch back to chat mode
```

## ðŸ’° API Costs

### OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **Cost**: ~$0.002 per conversation (150 tokens)
- **Monthly Estimate**:
  - 100 users Ã— 10 conversations/day = 1,000 conversations/day
  - 30,000 conversations/month = ~$60/month

### Cost Optimization
1. Use GPT-3.5-turbo (cheaper than GPT-4)
2. Limit max_tokens to 150 for voice responses
3. Cache common questions
4. Use shopping mode (free) whenever possible

---

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Configuration

### Switch to Anthropic Claude

Update the function to use Claude instead:

```python
def call_claude(prompt, user_id):
    """Call Anthropic Claude API"""
    # Implementation using Claude API
    pass
```

### Use Google Gemini

Update the function to use Gemini:

```python
def call_gemini(prompt, user_id):
    """Call Google Gemini API"""
    # Implementation using Gemini API
    pass
```

### Multi-Model Support

Let users choose their preferred AI:
```
User: "Set my AI to Claude"
AI Pro: "Great! I'll use Claude for our conversations now."
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Interaction Model Updates

### Add Fallback Intent

In `alexa-interaction-model-complete.json`, ensure you have:

```json
{
  "name": "AMAZON.FallbackIntent",
  "samples": []
}
```

This catches any unmatched utterances and routes them to general AI chat.

### Update LLMQueryIntent

```json
{
  "name": "LLMQueryIntent",
  "slots": [
    {
      "name": "Query",
      "type": "AMAZON.SearchQuery"
    }
  ],
  "samples": [
    "{Query}",
    "what is {Query}",
    "tell me about {Query}",
    "explain {Query}",
    "what's {Query}",
    "how does {Query} work"
  ]
}
```

---

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I'd love to chat, but I need an API key configured"
**Solution**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Lambda environment variables

### Issue: Responses are too long for voice
**Solution**: Reduce `max_tokens` in OpenAI call (currently 150)

### Issue: Not detecting shopping intent
**Solution**: Check `SHOPPING_KEYWORDS` list, add more keywords if needed

### Issue: Conversation context not saved
**Solution**: Check DynamoDB permissions for the Lambda role

---

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### CloudWatch Metrics to Watch
- **Intent Detection**: Check logs for "Detected intent: chat/shopping/cart"
- **API Calls**: Monitor OpenAI API usage
- **Response Times**: Ensure < 3 seconds for voice
- **Error Rates**: Watch for API failures

### Custom Logging
The function logs:
```
"User query: [query]"
"Detected intent: [chat/shopping/cart]"
"OpenAI error: [error message]"
```
