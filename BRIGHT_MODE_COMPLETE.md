## How to Test

### In Alexa Simulator (Always Fresh):
1. Go to Test tab
2. English (US)
3. "search for headphones"
4. Should show WHITE background immediately

### On Physical Echo Show (May Need Cache Clear):
1. Say: "Alexa, forget AI Pro"
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Say: "Alexa, open AI Pro"
4. Say: "search for headphones"

## If Still Showing Dark

### APL Cache Issue:
Echo Show devices cache APL documents. Solutions:

**Method 1: Skill Reset**
- Disable skill in Alexa app
- Wait 10 seconds  
- Re-enable skill
- Test again

**Method 2: Device Restart**
- Unplug Echo Show
- Wait 10 seconds
- Plug back in
- Test again

**Method 3: Change Token**
In Lambda, change APL token from `'shopping-products'` to `'shopping-products-v2'`
This forces new APL to load

## Next Deploy (If Needed)

If cache is the issue, you can force a new version:

```powershell
# Change APL token in lambda_ai_pro_secure.py
# Find: 'shopping-products'
# Replace with: 'shopping-products-bright-v1'

# This forces Alexa to reload the APL
```

---

Current deployment: Active and ready
Test in simulator first - that's always fresh!
