## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I didn't understand that"

**Possible Causes:**
1. API key not configured
2. DynamoDB table doesn't exist
3. Lambda function not deployed

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check Lambda environment variables
aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name ai-pro-skill --region us-east-1

# Verify API keys are set
# Should show OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

---

### Issue: Still Getting Shopping Responses for Chat

**Possible Causes:**
1. Old Lambda code still deployed
2. Cache not cleared

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Redeploy
.\deploy-friendly-chat.ps1

# Then test in Alexa console
# Say "Alexa, exit" and reopen skill
```

---

### Issue: AI Provider Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
1. API key invalid
2. API quota exceeded
3. Wrong API key format

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test API key directly
# OpenAI:
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"

# Should return list of models if key is valid
```

---

### Issue: Shopping Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
1. Intent detection too strict
2. Product catalog not loaded

**Fix:**
- Use explicit shopping words: "find", "search for", "buy"
- Example: "Find me headphones" (not "headphones")

---

## üîç Check AWS CloudWatch Logs

For detailed debugging:

1. Go to AWS Console
2. CloudWatch ‚Üí Log Groups
3. Find `/aws/lambda/ai-pro-skill`
4. Look for recent log streams
5. Search for:
   - `"Using AI provider:"` - Shows which AI is being used
   - `"Shopping intent detected"` - Shows shopping triggers
   - `"General chat intent"` - Shows chat mode
   - Errors or exceptions

---
