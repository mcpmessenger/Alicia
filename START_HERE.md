## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Deploy the New Code

Open PowerShell in this directory and run:

```powershell
.\deploy-friendly-chat.ps1
```

This will package and upload your new friendly chat assistant to AWS Lambda.

---

### Step 2: Set Up AI API Keys

You need at least ONE API key (ideally all three):

#### Get Your API Keys:

1. **OpenAI (GPT)**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign up/login → Create new secret key → Copy it

2. **Google Gemini**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Click "Get API Key" → Create key → Copy it

3. **Anthropic (Claude)**: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Sign up/login → API Keys → Create key → Copy it

#### Set Keys in AWS Lambda:

Run this command (replace with your actual keys):

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name ai-pro-skill \
  --environment Variables='{
    "OPENAI_API_KEY":"sk-your-openai-key-here",
    "GOOGLE_API_KEY":"your-google-gemini-key-here",
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY":"sk-ant-your-anthropic-key-here",
    "DYNAMODB_TABLE":"ai-assistant-users-dev"
  }' \
  --region us-east-1
```

**OR** Set them in AWS Console:
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
2. Click your function: `ai-pro-skill`
3. Configuration → Environment variables → Edit
4. Add the three API keys above

---

### Step 3: Test It!

1. Go to [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask)
2. Open your "AI Pro" skill
3. Click **Test** tab
4. Enable testing: "Development"

Try these:

```
"Alexa, open AI Pro"
> "Hey! I'm AI Pro. I love chatting about anything..."

"Tell me about black holes"
> [Detailed, engaging explanation]

"Use Gemini to explain quantum physics"
> [Gemini-powered response]

"Find me wireless headphones"
> [Shows shopping results - still works when needed!]
```

## 🎯 What Changed?

### Before (Shopping Assistant)
```
User: "Alexa, open AI Pro"
Alexa: "Welcome to AI Pro Shopping! What would you like 
        to shop for today?"

User: "Tell me a poem about lizards"
Alexa: "Your cart is empty. Add some items before checking out!"
```

### After (Friendly Chat Assistant)
```
User: "Alexa, open AI Pro"
Alexa: "Hey! I'm AI Pro. I love chatting about anything - 
        science, history, tech, you name it! What's on your mind?"

User: "Tell me a poem about lizards"
Alexa: [Actually writes a poem about lizards!]

User: "Find me wireless headphones"  
Alexa: [Shows products - shopping still works when needed!]
```

✅ **Chat about ANY topic**: Science, history, technology, philosophy, etc.  
✅ **Use 3 different AI providers**: Gemini, OpenAI (GPT), Claude  
✅ **Switch AIs on the fly**: "Use Gemini to explain..." or "Ask Claude about..."  
✅ **Remember conversations**: Context is preserved across the chat

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customize Welcome Messages

Edit `lambda_ai_pro_friendly_chat.py` (lines 29-36):

```python
WELCOME_MESSAGES = [
    "Your custom message here!",
    "Another friendly greeting!",
    # Add as many as you like
]
```

### Adjust Shopping Sensitivity

Make shopping detection more or less sensitive by editing `SHOPPING_KEYWORDS` (lines 39-43):

```python
SHOPPING_KEYWORDS = [
    'buy', 'purchase', 'shop', 'find product',
    # Add or remove keywords
]
```

### Change AI Response Style

Adjust temperature and length for each AI provider:

```python
"max_tokens": 200,     # Length (150-500 for voice)
"temperature": 0.8     # Creativity (0.7-0.9 for friendly)
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with One AI Provider**: Get OpenAI key first, it's the easiest
2. **Test Incrementally**: Deploy → Test chat → Add more AI keys
3. **Monitor Costs**: AI API calls cost money - check your usage
4. **Check CloudWatch Logs**: See which AI provider is being used
5. **Voice Optimize**: AI responses are automatically capped at 200 tokens for voice

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Problem: Still saying "Welcome to AI Pro Shopping"
**Fix**: Redeploy: `.\deploy-friendly-chat.ps1`

### Problem: "I didn't understand that" 
**Fix**: Check API keys are set in Lambda environment variables

### Problem: AI not responding
**Fix**: Verify your API key is valid - test at provider's website

### Problem: Shopping not working
**Fix**: Use explicit words: "find me", "search for", "buy"
