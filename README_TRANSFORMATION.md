## 💡 Example Conversations

### Before
```
User: "Tell me a poem about lizards"
Alexa: "Your cart is empty. Add some items before checking out!"
```

### After
```
User: "Tell me a poem about lizards"
Alexa: "Sure! Here's a poem:
        In the desert sand they bask,
        Scales that shimmer, what a task!
        Tiny dragons of the day,
        Sunlight dancing where they play..."
```

**Shopping still works:**
```
User: "Find me wireless headphones"
Alexa: "Sure! I found 10 great options..." [shows products]
```
